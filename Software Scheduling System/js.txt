That’s great! You already have a solid foundation in both front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Python) technologies. Here are some suggestions on what you could learn next to enhance your skills:

Frameworks and Libraries: Learning popular frameworks and libraries can make you more efficient and marketable. 
For JavaScript, consider learning React.js or Vue.js. 
For Python, Django or Flask are good choices.

Databases: Understanding how to work with databases is crucial for any software engineer. 
You could start with SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and then explore NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

Version Control Systems: If you haven’t already, learn Git for version control. 
It’s an industry standard and will help you manage and collaborate on projects effectively.

Testing: Learn how to write unit tests and use testing frameworks.
For JavaScript, you can look into Jest or Mocha. For Python, pytest is a good option.

DevOps: Familiarize yourself with Docker and Kubernetes, which are used for containerization and orchestration respectively. 
Also, learning CI/CD concepts can be beneficial.

Cloud Services: AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer a wide range of services and getting a basic understanding of these platforms can be very useful.
